                            <h4>Thermodynamics</h4>
                            <p><strong>Entropy</strong> (from Greek <em>en-</em> "in" + <em>tropē</em> "transformation") is a fundamental concept in physics that measures the degree of disorder or randomness in a system. According to the <strong>Second Law of Thermodynamics</strong>, the total entropy of an isolated system can never decrease over time—it either increases or remains constant.</p>
                            <blockquote>
                                "The entropy of the universe tends to a maximum." — Rudolf Clausius, 1865
                            </blockquote>
                            <p>In practical terms, this means that energy naturally disperses and systems naturally move toward states of greater disorder. A hot cup of coffee cools down, never spontaneously heating up. A broken glass doesn't reassemble itself. Time flows in one direction.</p>

                            <p>Claude Shannon introduced <strong>information entropy</strong> in 1948 as a measure of uncertainty or unpredictability in information content. In this context, entropy quantifies the average amount of information needed to describe a random variable.</p>
                            <p>High entropy means high unpredictability—like a truly random sequence of coin flips. Low entropy means predictability—like a message with repeating patterns. This concept is fundamental to data compression, cryptography, and understanding communication systems.</p>

                            <p>Entropy provides a thermodynamic arrow of time—a fundamental asymmetry that distinguishes past from future. While the microscopic laws of physics are time-reversible, entropy gives us a macroscopic direction: the future is the direction of increasing entropy.</p>
                            <p>This raises profound questions: Why did the universe begin in a low-entropy state? Is the heat death of the universe—maximum entropy—inevitable? What does this mean for free will, consciousness, and the nature of existence itself?</p>

                        <h3>A Personal Journey</h3>
                        <p>When I first encountered entropy in physics class, it seemed like just another abstract formula. But the more I explored it, the more I realized it's everywhere—in my daily life, my relationships, my creative work, and my understanding of existence.</p>

                        <h4>Entropy in Daily Life</h4>
                        <p>My room doesn't clean itself. My notes don't organize themselves. My digital files accumulate in chaotic folders. This isn't laziness—it's entropy. Maintaining order requires constant energy input. The moment I stop actively organizing, disorder naturally increases.</p>

                        <h4>Entropy in Relationships</h4>
                        <p>Relationships require work. Without effort, communication breaks down, misunderstandings accumulate, and connections fade. Like thermodynamic systems, relationships naturally drift toward disorder unless we actively maintain them through conversation, shared experiences, and mutual understanding.</p>

                        <h4>Entropy in Creativity</h4>
                        <p>As a creator, I've learned to embrace entropy. The blank page is low entropy—pure potential but no information. The creative process increases entropy: ideas scatter, drafts multiply, chaos reigns. But from this disorder emerges something new. Perhaps creativity is about channeling entropy productively.</p>

                        <h4>Entropy and Acceptance</h4>
                        <p>Understanding entropy has taught me acceptance. Not everything can be preserved. Not every system can be maintained. Change is inevitable. Decay is natural. The coffee will cool. The building will crumble. The star will die. And that's okay.</p>

                        <p class="personal-insight">Entropy isn't the enemy—it's the nature of reality. Fighting it is futile. Understanding it is liberating. Working with it is wisdom.</p>

              Entropy is often described as “disorder,” but many systems look chaotic while still obeying strict rules.
              This simulation is my way of showing that tension: deterministic motion that keeps generating new configurations,
              never settling into a perfectly overlapping, “finished” state.
            </p>

            <p>
              Here, a large set of planes rotates around the central axes according to precise mathematical constraints.
              They intersect, drift, and realign—sometimes appearing close to repetition—yet the system avoids total coincidence.
              Visually, it sits in the middle ground between order and randomness: structured, but endlessly unfolding.

            <h2 id="veritasium-title">Entropy, Engines, and the Illusion of Reversibility</h2>

            <p class="section-intro">
              A key insight that reshaped my understanding of entropy comes from a video by
              <em>Veritasium</em>, which reframes entropy not as “messiness,” but as a problem of
              probability, energy usefulness, and irreversible loss.
            </p>

            <p>
              In the video, a heat engine is used as the central example. The engine appears to
              create order: it converts heat into motion, lifts weights, and performs useful work.
              Locally, entropy can decrease. But this apparent victory is misleading.
            </p>

            <p>
              Every real engine leaks energy. Friction, heat dissipation, and microscopic randomness
              ensure that while order may emerge in one place, a larger amount of entropy is created
              elsewhere. The universe keeps score globally, not locally.
            </p>

            <div class="veritasium-frame">
              <iframe
                height="450"
                src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DxL2HoqLbyA"
                title="Veritasium — Entropy, Engines, and Time’s Arrow"

            </div>

            <p>
              The engine example exposes a deeper truth: entropy is about the gradual loss of
              <strong>usable energy</strong>. Once energy is evenly spread out, no engine—no matter
              how clever—can extract work from it again. This is why entropy gives time a direction.
            </p>

            <p>
              What makes this especially striking is that the underlying physical laws are reversible.
              Nothing in Newton’s equations forbids entropy from decreasing. It simply never happens
              on large scales because the number of high-entropy configurations overwhelms the low-entropy ones.
            </p>

            <p>
              This perspective connects directly to the rotating-plane simulation above. Like the engine,
              the system is fully deterministic. Nothing random is injected. Yet it never returns to a
              perfectly overlapping state. Not because it cannot—but because such states are vanishingly rare.
            </p>

            <p class="veritasium-note">
              Entropy, then, is not the breakdown of rules. It is what happens when rules are allowed
              to explore all their consequences.

                <div class="reflection-content">
                    <p class="reflection-text">Researching entropy has fundamentally changed how I perceive reality. It's not just a physics concept—it's a lens through which to understand everything from the cooling of stars to the decay of civilizations, from the corruption of digital files to the fading of memories.</p>

                    <p class="reflection-text">The Second Law of Thermodynamics is often called the most depressing law in physics. Everything tends toward disorder. Everything decays. The universe marches inexorably toward heat death. But I've come to see beauty in this truth.</p>

                    <div class="reflection-quote">
                        <blockquote>
                            "Entropy is time's arrow, but it's also life's challenge. Every moment we maintain order—in our minds, our work, our relationships—we're pushing back against the universe's natural tendency. We're creating temporary islands of negentropy in an ocean of chaos. And that's what makes existence meaningful."
                        </blockquote>
                    </div>

                    <p class="reflection-text">Understanding entropy has taught me to value maintenance as much as creation, to appreciate the energy required to preserve what we have, and to accept that letting go is sometimes the natural course of things.</p>

                    <p class="reflection-text">In the end, entropy reminds us that we're part of something larger—a universe unfolding according to fundamental laws. We can't stop entropy, but we can dance with it, work with it, and find meaning in the temporary order we create before it all returns to chaos.</p>
